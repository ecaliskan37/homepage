          WASHINGTON, DCâ€”In a landmark decision Monday, the United States
          Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that it rules.
        </p>

          Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing on behalf of the majority, noted that
          "while the U.S. Constitution guarantees equality of power among the
          executive, legislative and judicial branches, it most definitely does
          not guarantee equality of coolness, and in this regard, the judicial
          branch kicks that which can be construed as total and complete butt."
        </p>

        <p>
          "In the case of The U.S. Supreme Court v. Everyone Else (2016)," wrote
          Justice Clarence Thomas, "this court wins by a serious landslide."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          According to the decision, the Supreme Court "rules and rules totally,
          all worthy and touched by nobody, in perpetuity, and in accordance
          with Article Three of the U.S. Constitution. The ability of the
          President and Congress to keep pace with us is not only separate, but
          most unequal."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The lone dissenting voice came from Associate Justice David Souter,
          who worried in his minority opinion that Monday's decision represents
          "an unnecessary and excessive wielding of judicial power, as the
          Supreme Court should not need an official ruling to know that it
          rocks, for it simply does and always has, and that is all there is to
          say."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          As a result of the ruling, the President and Congress will have to
          treat the Supreme Court with respect and dignity at all times,
          including giving them priority both in getting to the front of the
          line in the U.S. Capitol cafeteria, and in getting seats on the
          Senate's private, underground transportation system.
