      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        1 quart of cream
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1 wineglassful of curaçao
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1/2 pound of sugar
      </ul>
      <ul>
        2 tablespoonfuls of orange blossoms water
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Juice of two oranges
      </ul>

      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <div>
        Put the sugar and half the cream over the fire in a         double boiler. When
        the sugar is dissolved, take it from the fire, and    let it cool. When
        cold, add the curaçao, orange juice and orange blossoms water, and the
        remaining cream.Freeze.

        <h4>Instructions for freezing Needed equipment: </h4>
        <ul> 4-quart freezer </ul>
        <ul>  10 lb. ice 3 pints coarse rock salt </ul>
         </ol>
        </div>
        <span>
        Before beginning to
        pack the freezer, turn the crank to see that all the machinery is in
        working order. Pound the ice in a large bag with a mallet, or use an
        ordinary ice shaver. The finer the ice, the less time it takes to freeze
        the cream. You may pack the freezer with a layer of ice three inches
        thick, then a layer of salt one inch thick, or mix the ice and salt in
        the tub and shovel it around the freezer. Open the can and turn in the
        mixture that is to be frozen. Turn the crank slowly and steadily until
        the mixture begins to freeze, then more rapidly until it is completely
        frozen.
